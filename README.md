# COSC 310 - Individual Project
Computer science 310 Individual project repository  
### Description
* This is a project that was completed for a Software Engineering course (course id: COSC 310) at the University of British Columbia. The objective of this project was to design a call center bot to help diagnose basic computer software and hardware issues. It was implemented using a Neural Network using the TensorFlow module and Python 3.8 (more can be found [here](https://github.com/COSC310-Team7/Pawan_IndividualProject/blob/master/Assignment3/NeuralNet_Agent/README.md)).
